    "# Introduction to Countdown\n",
    "Countdown is a TV show where players have to solve different puzzles within a certain number of seconds. We will focus in on the number game which consists of solving a calculation within 30 seconds. The contestant in control chooses six of 24 cards without knowing what the card is. The cards consist of 20 small numbers which are 1-10 (2 cards of each number), and 4 large numbers (25, 50, 75, 100). The contestant in control chooses how many large numbers are to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the 6 numbers are displayed the electronic machine known as CECIL (Countdown's Electronic Calculator in Leeds) generates a random number between 101 and 999 inclusive. The aim of the game is to use the 6 numbers given and use addition, subtraction, multiplication and/or division to return the randomised 3 digit number generated by CECIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "- Each number can only be used once \n",
    "- Division cannot be done if it returns a remainder.\n",
    "- We are not forced to use all the numbers given, we can leave some out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points\n",
    "The contestants can receive points if they are closest to the answer when nobody gets the correct answer:\n",
    "- 10 points for getting the exact answer\n",
    "- 7 points for getting between one and five from the answer\n",
    "- 5 points for getting between six and ten from the answer\n",
    "\n",
    " ***NOTE: The contestants cannot recieve points for being close to the answer if another contestant has gotten the right answer.***"

    "And CECIL generated the number 275.\n",

    "# Computation Complexity\n",
    "At first we might think that this problem isn't hard enough to solve using an algorithm but as we delve into the different possibilities of calculations from these 6 numbers, we can see that brute forcing this algorithm can be time inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to Take Into Account\n",
    "- There are 4 different operations we can do with numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)\n",
    "- The position of the numbers in the calculation matter\n",
    "  - (1 + 2 * 3) returns 7\n",
    "  - (3 + 2 * 1) returns 5\n",
    "  - This means we need to take into account each possible comination of numbers with different positions (unless all the operations are addition)\n",
    "- We don't need to use all the numbers from the list of 6 numbers. \n",
    "  - We can use the binomial coefficient calculation to figure out the number of sets we can retrieve from a list of 6 numbers\n",
    "  - Example of all possible sets of 2 from the list of 6 numbers:\n"
