    "# Introduction to Countdown\n",
    "Countdown is a TV show where players have to solve different puzzles within a certain number of seconds. We will focus in on the number game which consists of solving a calculation within 30 seconds. The contestant in control chooses six of 24 cards without knowing what the card is. The cards consist of 20 small numbers which are 1-10 (2 cards of each number), and 4 large numbers (25, 50, 75, 100). The contestant in control chooses how many large numbers are to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the 6 numbers are displayed the electronic machine known as CECIL (Countdown's Electronic Calculator in Leeds) generates a random number between 101 and 999 inclusive. The aim of the game is to use the 6 numbers given and use addition, subtraction, multiplication and/or division to return the randomised 3 digit number generated by CECIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "- Each number can only be used once \n",
    "- Division cannot be done if it returns a remainder.\n",
    "- We are not forced to use all the numbers given, we can leave some out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points\n",
    "The contestants can receive points if they are closest to the answer when nobody gets the correct answer:\n",
    "- 10 points for getting the exact answer\n",
    "- 7 points for getting between one and five from the answer\n",
    "- 5 points for getting between six and ten from the answer\n",

    "## Possible Calculations\n",
    "To get all the possible calculations we need to take into account that there are **6 numbers**, we do not need to use all the numbers, and there are 4 operations between 2 numbers that we can do.\n",

    "### Using 1 number\n",
    "It used to be possible to get an answer with 1 number when the random number was between 100 - 999, instead of 101 - 999. If you got 100 as the result and you had 100 as one of your numbers you got the answer right.\n",

    "$$ \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ 15\\times 2! = 30 $$\n",

    "So we have 30 different sets of numbers. Now we need to multiply the combinations by the different operations we can do (+, -, *, /) Which in the case of 2 numbers is \n",
